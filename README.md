# Crowdfunding_ETL



For the Contacts dataframe, we chose to do Option 1 to transform the data using Pandas instead of regex.  In order to split the first name and last name I looked on Saturncloud.io to find an example on how to split the string and set it to two separate columns.  We also used the QuickDBD tool to create the ERD and schema for the crowdfunding database.
